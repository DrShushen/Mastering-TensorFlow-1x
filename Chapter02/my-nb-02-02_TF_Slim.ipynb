    "# TF Slim\n",
    "\n",
    "> TF Slim is a lightweight library built on top of TensorFlow core for defining and training models. TF Slim can be used in conjunction with other TensorFlow low level and high-level libraries such as TF Learn. The TF Slim comes as part of the TensorFlow installation in the package: `tf.contrib.slim`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** We shall use TF Slim for learning how to use pre-trained models such as VGG16 and Inception V3 in later chapters.\n",

    "### TF Slim Workflow:\n",
    "1. Create the model using slim layers.\n",
    "2. Provide the input to the layers to instantiate the model.\n",
    "3. Use the logits and labels to define the loss.\n",
    "4. Get the total loss using convenience function `get_total_loss()`.\n",
    "5. Create an optimizer.\n",
    "6. Create a training function using convenience function `slim.learning.create_train_op()`, `total_loss` and `optimizer`.\n",
    "7. Run the training using the convenience function `slim.learning.train()` and training function defined in the previous step."
